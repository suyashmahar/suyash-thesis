  I have truly enjoyed my PhD experience, which would not have been possible without the contribution of several people. I am deeply thankful to my advisor, Steven Swanson for all his support, guidance and fun conversations throughout my PhD.
  
  I would like to thank Terence Kelly who helped with several technical discussions, feedback on my writing, and advice on how to handle different aspects of my PhD life. Special thanks to Professor Joseph Izraelevitz, who guided me in shaping my research project during the early stages of my PhD. I also acknowledge my collaborators from various industry internships that helped me better understand commercial implications of my research. Thanks to Abhishek Dhanotia 
  and Hao Wang for providing insights into needs and operations of hyperscalars. I am equally thankful to Professor Samira Khan and Professor Baris Kasikci for their guidance during my internship at Google.
  
  I am also deeply indebted to people who helped me get into research during my undergraduate which led me to where I am today. Professor Saugata Ghose and Dr. Rachata Ausavarungnirun who not only sparked my interest in Computer Architecture but have helped me over the years. Thanks to Professor Ran Ginosar and Professor Leonid Yavits who helped me get started in the field of Persistent Memories and a wonderful summer in Haifa.

  
  
  A special thanks to Professor Samira Khan for providing me opportunities during my undergraduate years, enabling me to make significant contributions to research projects, helping with my PhD applications, and providing support and guidance over the years. My thanks also goes to everyone at SHIFTLAB who helped me when I was getting started with research, especially Sihang Liu, Korakit Seemakhupt and Yasas Seneviratne.
  
  
  I am grateful to all the fun times I had at UCSD. Ziheng, thank you for being a great friend and roommate. Mingyao, I will always appreciate all your restaurant recommendations! Nara, your support means a lot. Zixuan, you were always helpful in figuring out how to navigate various stuff, both in life and at UCSD. Yanbo, thank you for being the perfect travel companion! Seungjin, Ehsan, Zifeng, YJ, Juno, and Theo---thank you for all the fun and unforgettable memories.
  
  
  Finally, I would like to thank my parents, who provided me with support and encouragement during my PhD. My girlfriend, Caleigh, who has always been supportive and encouraging.
