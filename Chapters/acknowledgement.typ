  I have really enjoyed my PhD experience. 
  
  This dissertation would not have been possible without the contribution of several people. I am deeply thankful to my advisor, Steven Swanson for all his support, guidance and fun conversations during my PhD.
  
  
  I would also like to thank Terence Kelly who helped with several technical discussions, feedback on my writing, and advice on how to handle different aspects of my PhD life. Special thanks to Professor Joseph Izraelevitz, who helped me shape my research project when I was just starting out my PhD. I would also like to thank my collaborators from several industry internships that helped me get a better understanding of commercial implications of my research. Thanks to Abhishek Dhanotia 
  and Hao Wang for providing insights into needs and operations of hyperscalars. Thanks to Professor Samira Khan and Professor Baris Kasikci for their guidance during my internship at Google.
  
  I am also deeply indebdted to people who helped me get into research during my undergraduate which led me to where I am today. Professor Saugata Ghose and Dr. Rachata Ausavarungnirun who have helped not only spark my interest in Computer Archicture but have helped me over the years. Thanks to Professor Ran Ginosar and Professor Leonid Yavits who helped me get started in the field of Persistent Memories an a wonderful summer in Haifa.
  
  I am grateful to all the fun times I had at UCSD. Ziheng for being a great friend and roommate. Mingyao for all his restaurant recommendations! Nara for all the support. Zixuan for helping me figure out various processes at UCSD and life. Yanbo for being the perfect travel companion! Seungjin, Ehsan, Zifeng, YJ, and Theo for all the fun memories.
  
  
  A special thanks to Professor Samira Khan for providing me opportunities during my undergrad to make significant contributions to research projects, helping me with my PhD applications, and providing support and guidance over the years. I would also like to thanks everyone at SHIFTLAB who helped me when I was getting started with my research, especially, Korakit Seemakhupt and Yasas Seneviratne.
  
  
  Finally, I would like to thank my parents without who provided me support and encouragement during my PhD. My girlfriend, Caleigh who has always been supportive and encouraging.
