Error characterization of MLC and SLC flash is given on the block, page, and bit level. Based on our error characterization in MLC flash, we propose an error-correcting scheme which outperforms the conventional BCH code. We compare several schemes which use an MLC flash block as an SLC block. Finally, an implementation of two-write WOM-codes in SLC flash is given as well as the BER for the first and second write.},
