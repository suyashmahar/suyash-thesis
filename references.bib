By utilizing memory-mapped IO, researchers have attempted to provide fast IOs without kernel mode switches and complex kernel IO layers. Even though they improve the performance by taking advantage of NVMM characteristics, memory-mapped IOs still require additional user-level logging techniques to guarantee write atomicity and file system integrity. We propose a user-level library file system, Libpubl, which is designed to minimize the write amplification overhead of traditional logging by exploiting persistent user buffers as logs. Libpubl ensures atomic updates of data and improves the performance and the scalability. Compared to the state-of-the-art NVM file systems, Libpubl increases the performance by 50~120% in Fio benchmark.},

A simple interface offers applications a guarantee that the application data in a file always reflects the most recent successful fsync or msync operation on the file. Our file system furthermore offers a new syncv mechanism that failure-atomically commits changes to multiple files. Failure-injection tests verify that our file system protects the integrity of application data from crashes and performance measurements confirm that our implementation is efficient. Our file system runs on conventional hardware and unmodified Linux kernels and will be released commercially. We believe that our mechanism is implementable in any file system that supports per-file writable snapshots.},

In contrast to certain prior work, but in keeping with ``real world'' systems, we assume a full-system failure model, in which all transient state (of all processes) is lost on a crash. We introduce the notion of durable linearizability to govern the safety of concurrent objects under this failure model and a corresponding relaxed, buffered variant which ensures that the persistent state in the event of a crash is consistent but not necessarily up to date.}

	abstract     = {Persistent memory ({PM}) technologies aim to revolutionize storage systems, providing persistent storage at near-{DRAM} speeds. Alas, programming {PM} systems is error-prone, as the misuse or omission of the durability mechanisms (i.e., cache flushes and memory fences) can lead to durability bugs (i.e., unflushed updates in {CPU} caches that violate crash consistency). {PM}-specific testing and debugging tools can help developers find these bugs, however even with such tools, fixing durability bugs can be challenging. To determine the reason behind this difficulty, we first study durability bugs and find that although the solution to a durability bug seems simple, the actual reasoning behind the fix can be complicated and timeconsuming. Overall, the severity of these bugs coupled with the difficultly of developing fixes for them motivates us to consider automated approaches to fixing durability bugs.},

A distributed Java Virtual Machine supports transparent parallel execution of multi-threaded Java programs on a cluster of computers. It provides an alternative platform for high-performance scientific computations. In this paper, we present the design of a global object space for a distributed JVM. It virtualizes a single Java object heap across machine boundaries to facilitate transparent object accesses. We leverage runtime object connectivity information to detect distributed shared objects (DSOs) that are reachable from threads at different nodes to facilitate efficient memory management in the distributed JVM. Based on the concept of DSO, we propose a framework to characterize object access patterns, along three orthogonal dimensions. With this framework, we are able to effectively calibrate the runtime memory access patterns and dynamically apply optimized cache coherence protocols to minimize consistency maintenance overhead. The optimization devices include an object home migration method that optimizes the single-writer access pattern, synchronized method migration that allows the execution of a synchronized method to take place remotely at the home node of its locked object, and connectivity-based object pushing that uses object connectivity information to optimize the producer--consumer access pattern. Several benchmark applications in scientific computing have been tested on our distributed JVM. We report the performance results and give an in-depth analysis of the effects of the proposed adaptive solutions.},

	abstract     = {Preserving the integrity of application data across updates is difficult if power outages and system crashes may occur during updates. Existing approaches such as relational databases and transactional key-value stores restrict programming flexibility by mandating narrow data access interfaces. We have designed, implemented, and evaluated an approach that strengthens the semantics of a standard operating system primitive while maintaining conceptual simplicity and supporting highly flexible programming: Failureatomic msync() commits changes to a memory-mapped file atomically, even in the presence of failures. Our Linux implementation of failure-atomic msync() has preserved application data integrity across hundreds of whole-machine power interruptions and exhibits good microbenchmark performance on both spinning disks and solid-state storage. Failure-atomic msync() supports higher layers of fully general programming abstraction, e.g., a persistent heap that easily slips beneath the C++ Standard Template Library. An STL <map> built atop failure-atomic msync() outperforms several local key-value stores that support transactional updates. We integrated failure-atomic msync() into the Kyoto Tycoon key-value server by modifying exactly one line of code; our modified server reduces response times by 26--43% compared to Tycoon's existing transaction support while providing the same data integrity guarantees. Compared to a Tycoon server setup that makes almost no I/O (and therefore provides no support for data durability and integrity over failures), failure-atomic msync() incurs a three-fold response time increase on a fast Flash-based SSD---an acceptable cost of data reliability for many.},

This has led to research into NVM programming models, where persistent data structures remain in memory and are accessed directly through CPU loads and stores. Existing mechanisms for transactional updates are not appropriate in such a setting as they are optimized for block-based storage. We present REWIND, a user-mode library approach to managing transactional updates directly from user code written in an imperative general-purpose language. REWIND relies on a custom persistent in-memory data structure for the log that supports recoverable operations on itself. The scheme also employs a combination of non-temporal updates, persistent memory fences, and lightweight logging. Experimental results on synthetic transactional workloads and TPC-C show the overhead of REWIND compared to its non-recoverable equivalent to be within a factor of only 1.5 and 1.39 respectively. Moreover, REWIND outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for data structure recoverability as well as general purpose and NVM-aware DBMS-based recovery schemes by up to two orders of magnitude.},

	abstract     = {Persistent Memory (PM) makes possible recoverable applications that can preserve application progress across system reboots and power failures. Actual recoverability requires careful ordering of cacheline flushes, currently done in two extreme ways. On one hand, expert programmers have reasoned deeply about consistency and durability to create applications centered on a single custom-crafted durable datastructure. On the other hand, less-expert programmers have used software transaction memory (STM) to make atomic one or more updates, albeit at a significant performance cost due largely to ordered log updates.In this work, we propose the middle ground of composable persistent datastructures called Minimally Ordered Durable datastructures (MOD). We prototype MOD as a library of C++ datastructures---currently, map, set, stack, queue and vector---that often perform better than STM and yet are relatively easy to use. They allow multiple updates to one or more datastructures to be atomic with respect to failure. Moreover, we provide a recipe to create additional recoverable datastructures.MOD is motivated by our analysis of real Intel Optane PM hardware showing that allowing unordered, overlapping flushes significantly improves performance. MOD reduces ordering by adapting existing techniques for out-of-place updates (like shadow paging) with space-reducing structural sharing (from functional programming). MOD exposes a Basic interface for single updates and a Composition interface for atomically performing multiple updates. Relative to widely used Intel PMDK v1.5 STM, MOD improves map, set, stack, queue microbenchmark performance by 40%, and speeds up application benchmark performance by 38%.},

A slow memory allocator can bottleneck the entire application stack, while an unsecure memory allocator can render applications inconsistent upon program bugs or system failure. Unlike DRAM-based memory allocators, it is indispensable for an NVMM allocator to guarantee its heap metadata safety from both internal and external errors. An effective NVMM memory allocator should be 1) safe, 2) scalable, and 3) high performing. Unfortunately, none of the existing persistent memory allocators achieve all three requisites. For example, we found that even Intel's de-facto NVMM allocator-libpmemobj is vulnerable to silent data corruption and persistent memory leaks resulting from a simple heap overflow.In this paper, we propose Poseidon, a safe, fast, and scalable persistent memory allocator. The premise of Poseidon revolves around providing a user application with per-CPU sub-heaps for scalability and high performance, while managing the heap metadata in a segregated fashion and efficiently protecting the metadata using a scalable hardware-based protection scheme, Intel's Memory Protection Keys (MPK). We evaluate Poseidon with a wide array of microbenchmarks and real-world benchmarks, noting: Poseidon outperforms the state-of-art allocators by a significant margin, showing improved scalability and performance, while also guaranteeing heap metadata protection.},

However, designing durable concurrent data structures that are correct and efficient has proven to be very difficult, leading to many inefficient or incorrect algorithms. In this paper, we present a general transformation that takes a lock-free data structure from a general class called traversal data structure (that we formally define) and automatically transforms it into an implementation of the data structure for the NVRAM setting that is provably durably linearizable and highly efficient. The transformation hinges on the observation that many data structure operations begin with a traversal phase that does not need to be persisted, and thus we only begin persisting when the traversal reaches its destination. We demonstrate the transformation's efficiency through extensive measurements on a system with Intel's recently released Optane DC persistent memory, showing that it can outperform competitors on many workloads.},

Nevertheless, designing crash-resilient algorithms and data structures is complex and error-prone as caches and machine registers are still volatile and the data residing in memory after a crash might not reflect a consistent view of the program state. This complex setting has often led to durable data structures being inefficient or incorrect, especially in the concurrent setting.  In this paper, we present Mirror -- a simple, general automatic transformation that adds durability to lock-free data structures, with a low performance overhead. Moreover, in the current non-volatile main memory configuration, where non-volatile memory operates side-by-side with a standard fast DRAM, our mechanism exploits the hybrid system to substantially improve performance. Evaluation shows a significant performance advantage over NVTraverse, which is the state-of-the-art general transformation technique, and over Intel's concurrent lock-based key-value datastore. Unlike some previous transformations, Mirror does not require any restriction on the lock-free data structure format.},

However, building these data structures is hard because their data must be consistent in the wake of a failure. Existing methods for building persistent data structures require either in-depth code changes to an existing data structure using an NVMM-aware library or rewriting the data structure from scratch. Unfortunately, both of these methods are labor-intensive and error-prone.Pronto is a new NVMM library that reduces the programming effort required to add persistence to volatile data structures using asynchronous semantic logging (ASL). ASL is generic enough to allow programmers to add persistence to the existing volatile data structure (e.g., C++ Standard Template Library containers) with very little programming effort. Furthermore, ASL moves most durability code off the critical path, and our evaluation shows Pronto data structures outperform highly-optimized NVMM data structures written with other libraries by a large margin.},

	abstract     = {A 4-Gb AG-AND flash memory was fabricated by using a 90-nm CMOS technology. To reduce cell size, an inversion-layer-bit-line technology was developed, enabling the elimination of both shallow trench isolations and diffusion layers from the memory cells. The inversion-layer-bit-line technology combined with a multilevel cell technique achieved a bit area 2F2 of 0.0162 {micro}m2, resulting in a chip size of 126 mm2. Both an address and temperature compensation techniques control the resistance of the inversion-layer local bit line. Source-side hot-electron injection programming with self-boosted charge, accumulated in inversion-layer bit lines under assist gates, reduces the dispersal of programming characteristics and also reduces the time overhead of pre-charging the bit lines. This self-boosted charge-injection scheme achieves a programming throughput of 10 MB/s.},

The discovery of tunnel magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions has allowed the emergence of a new kind of non-volatile memory called magnetic random access memory (MRAM). It potentially combines the advantages of all existing memories: non-volatility of FLASH, speed of SRAM, density of DRAM, hardness to ionizing radiations and endurance. Many research groups are nowadays investigating the use of these magnetic components for other logic applications. Spintronic phenomenon is the spin transfer effect allows controlling the magnetization of a magnetic nanostructure directly with a spin-polarized current. It attracts a considerable interest since it provides a new write scheme in MRAM and allows conceiving frequency tunable RF components.},

	abstract     = {A novel nonvolatile memory utilizing spin torque transfer magnetization switching (STS), abbreviated spin-RAM hereafter, is presented for the first time. The spin-RAM is programmed by magnetization reversal through an interaction of a spin momentum-torque-transferred current and a magnetic moment of memory layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), and therefore an external magnetic field is unnecessary as that for a conventional MRAM. This new programming mode has been accomplished owing to our tailored MTJ, which has an oval shape of 100 times 150 nm. The memory cell is based on a 1-transistor and a 1-MTJ (ITU) structure. The 4kbit spin-RAM was fabricated on a 4 level metal, 0.18 mum CMOS process. In this work, writing speed as high as 2 ns, and a write current as low as 200 muA were successfully demonstrated. It has been proved that spin-RAM possesses outstanding characteristics such as high speed, low power and high scalability for the next generation universal memory},

	abstract     = {Achievement gaps increase income inequality and decrease workplace diversity by contributing to the attrition of underrepresented students from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. We collected data on exam scores and failure rates in a wide array of STEM courses that had been taught by the same instructor via both traditional lecturing and active learning, and analyzed how the change in teaching approach impacted underrepresented minority and low-income students. On average, active learning reduced achievement gaps in exam scores and passing rates. Active learning benefits all students but offers disproportionate benefits for individuals from underrepresented groups. Widespread implementation of high-quality active learning can help reduce or eliminate achievement gaps in STEM courses and promote equity in higher education.We tested the hypothesis that underrepresented students in active-learning classrooms experience narrower achievement gaps than underrepresented students in traditional lecturing classrooms, averaged across all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and courses. We conducted a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished studies that compared the performance of underrepresented students to their overrepresented classmates in active-learning and traditional-lecturing treatments. This search resulted in data on student examination scores from 15 studies (9,238 total students) and data on student failure rates from 26 studies (44,606 total students). Bayesian regression analyses showed that on average, active learning reduced achievement gaps in examination scores by 33\% and narrowed gaps in passing rates by 45\%. The reported proportion of time that students spend on in-class activities was important, as only classes that implemented high-intensity active learning narrowed achievement gaps. Sensitivity analyses showed that the conclusions are robust to sampling bias and other issues. To explain the extensive variation in efficacy observed among studies, we propose the heads-and-hearts hypothesis, which holds that meaningful reductions in achievement gaps only occur when course designs combine deliberate practice with inclusive teaching. Our results support calls to replace traditional lecturing with evidence-based, active-learning course designs across the STEM disciplines and suggest that innovations in instructional strategies can increase equity in higher education.},
